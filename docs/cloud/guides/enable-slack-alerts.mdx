## Connect Slack

On the environment configuration in Elementary Cloud, click on the "Connect Slack" button.
After you approve the Elementary Cloud app, select the default Slack channel to which you'd like to send alerts, and the [suppression interval](https://docs.elementary-data.com/cloud/guides/alerts-configuration#suppression-interval).
Afterwards you will be redirected back to the environment configuration page.
