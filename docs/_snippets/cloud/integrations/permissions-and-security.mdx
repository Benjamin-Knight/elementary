#### Permissions and security

Elementary cloud doesn't require read permissions to your tables and schemas, but only the following:

- Read-only access to the elementary schema.
- Metadata access to tables within your dbt databases (information schema and query history only - no read access required)

It is recommended to create a user using the instructions specified above to avoid granting excess privileges.
For more details, refer to [security and privacy](/cloud/general/security-and-privacy).
